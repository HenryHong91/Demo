# Full-Stack Application

### [Live Demo](https://henryhong91.github.io/Demo/)

## Overview
This project is a full-stack web application built with modern technologies, designed to deliver high performance, security, and scalability. It leverages **React** and **Vite** for the frontend, **ASP.NET Core** for the backend API, and **SQL** for the database layer. The project also integrates **Azure CI/CD** for continuous integration and deployment, along with **Single Sign-On (SSO)** for secure authentication.

## Background
Originally, the application was a legacy desktop solution that operated locally to manage manufacturing processes for different stakeholders, such as sales managers and operations managers. However, the desktop-only setup posed accessibility challenges, requiring modernisation. The updated solution includes a web application with modern design, improved accessibility, and enhanced usability across devices and platforms, making it more convenient for stakeholders to access the application anywhere.

This end-to-end project retains the core structure of the legacy desktop app while introducing a newly designed UI to provide a modern prototype. Throughout the development process, feedback from end users was continuously incorporated, ensuring that the application met their needs and expectations.
